- [Question] **_How to install NodeJS?_**  
- [Answer] The easiest way to install NodeJS is using **Node Version Manager** (NVM). Just follow this link and you will be fine: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating

## License
I set "[The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)" as the license of this repository. In other words, you can use this for everything you want.
- Want to use it? Do it.
- Want to modify it? Do it.
- Want to change the logo and sell it like "your own hand-made solution"? I wouldn't like to see this but you are free, then go ahead and do it.

The internet is fundamentally free and decentralized. It's foolish try to control what, at all times, is replicated between dozens and dozens of data centers around the world to ensure the availability of information. 

We don't even know which servers are storing this content. Honestly, we do not know the settings, the exact physical location, the name of the supplier that sold the physical components of the servers, the supplier who performs periodic maintenance on the data centers, the company that periodically audits each data center rack, or who are the people who worked (and still work daily) to ensure that this content was available for you when you accessed it from your browser.

It makes sense that little and insignificant message that you need to put in your tiny stretch of code for "preserving your intellectual property" (or inflate the fucking of your wounded ego)? Reflect on that, thank you :)

## Letter to police, legal, investigative and other related departments

This is an open source code. This means that it is free to be visualized, copied, transferred, **USED**, modified and sold **BY OTHERS** without my consent or any explicit authorization on my part.

Any actions, whether malicious or not, performed on your systems by this code is not my responsibility. I do not participate (and I do not have knowledge of those who participate) of "gray" actions. If you were negatively affected, I guarantee that I did not take part or performed any action for that result.

The purpose of this message is to preserve my physical, mental and spiritual integrity of possible sanctions for actions that were not my own, in the case of this tool caused some kind of damage.
